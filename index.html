            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Dylan Cole is a C# SDET, currently working as a consultant from Sparta Global.
                He has attention to detail, teamed with a strong work ethic and a willingness
                to learn new things. Perhaps in the future, he could be an author - as a 
                side gig.
            </p>
            <p>
                Formerly, Dylan worked seasonally as a Ride Operator at Stourport Fairground.
                Due to his personality, he was well-liked by both staff and clientelle. The fair
                is still owned by Henry Danter, and is currently run by his former partner Christine
                Collins. The ride was a Pinfari Dragon Coaster, and since the Italian rollercoaster
                manufacturing company has gone bankrupt, such a ride is incredibly rare!
            </p>
            <p>
                Dylan was also an ambassador for Swansea University while doing his degree,
                and also did a small stint at an on-campus COVID-19 testing facility before Christmas of 2020. 
                He also worked at TESCO during the first March 2020 lockdown, finding that it took
                around 4 weeks for new toilet rolls to be in stock!
            </p>
            <p>
                When not carrying out coding work, Dylan will either do some reading, novel-based 
                writing, learn a new meal to cook at home, drawing & art, or even play an occasional
                TV-game, such as <em>Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</em>. As for telly shows,
                He is a fan of adventure shows such as <em>Fort Boyard</em>, as well as comedy
                shows like <em>Taskmaster</em> and <em>Seinfeld</em>. Also, <em> The Simpsons</em>
                used to be good.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my programming based career, I have used the following languages:-

                <li>C</li>
                <li>Haskell</li>
                <li>Prolog</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>C#</li>
            </ul>

                    <p>
                        Working with a group in a scrum style, in order to create an interface for a weather app
                        for a fictional paragliding school.
