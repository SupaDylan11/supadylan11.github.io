            <h1>I HATE WINDOWS 10!!!</h1>
            <p>
                Correction: <em>I love Windows 10</em>. Well, maybe not love, but it certainly
                a good operating system. It has some nice and decent features, and works well
                for the things I need to do. Unlike Windows 11, I can also have the legacy
                small labelled taskbar - which I feel works best for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am running Windows using BOOTCAMP for Macintosh. Which is a long story. I was
                initially using Mac for my coding, however, I ran into issues while trying to deal 
                with SQL related work. This caused me to swap to Windows on my Mac computer, which
                works well. But there is just one thing...
            </p>
            <h3>THERE IS NO CLASSIC MODE!</h3>
            <p>
                Just <em>why?</em> Classic mode was included in Windows 7, but not with Windows 10.
                This left the childish looking Windows 10 Metro theme, which is one aspect of my
                system that I absolutely despise. So I had a search for an application called
                WindowBlinds by Stardock. It costs money, but it allows me to have a classic based
                theme. With much tinkering of different window applications , and the use of Classic Shell - I was
                able to tailor Windows 10 to my whim - and I am one satisfied customer.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's worth crediting the people who made certain aspects of my new old Windows experience.
                <ul>
                    <li>WindowBlinds10 - Stardock</li>
                    <li>OpenShell Start Button - dogchew57 - DeviantART</li>
                    <li>Classic Theme - SemoB - WinCustomize</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not perfect. But I'd like to thank these lovely people for making my Windows 10
                experience much better.
            </p>
